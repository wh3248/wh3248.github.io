This is the web page for Bill Hasling.

Interests
======
I am a software engineer. I am interested in developing and maintaining software. I am especially
interested in performance puzzles to figure out how to make code faster and automation
to make code more reliable.

Recent Experience
======
I am working in Hydrogology related software engineering in the Maxwell lab in
the Civil Engineering department at Princeton working with large CPU/GPU clusters and pedabytes of data.

Recently I have been working mostly in python, javascript, react, shell scripts and CI/CD with Jenkins and GitHub actions.
I also do maintenance with software in C/C++ and Fortran.
